## [0.3.0]
    column spacing and margin params

## [0.2.0]
    added additional heights and cleaned up the margins
    the filter is now shown when you long press on a field header

## [0.1.0]
    updated dependencies

## [0.0.3]
    overflow problem on resize fixed

## [0.0.2]
    √show a dropdown for the different filter types (add greater than, less than, between & equals)
    √have an option to add a scrollable to my rows

## future ideas
    have an option for filter button (magnifying glass) to appear above the column headers)
    truncate a cell's text instead of wrapping text
    have an option hover over a cell and that will show longer texts (alternative to wrapping)
    have an option scroll horizontally to show longer texts (alternative to wrapping)
    filter should filter on the formatted text but sort should sort on the unformatted text
    create a date datatype & sort & filter correctly
    create a boolean datatype & sort & filter correctly
    create a other datatypes & sort & filter correctly
    update examples
    reusableDataGridW.dart:124:to do: add tests here as is complicated
